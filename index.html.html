As a human who often face pressure, stress, and emotional or mental exhaustion, <a href="https://hastinpratiwi.com/manfaat-meditasi/">meditation</a> is very helpful in reducing all that pressure.

Another benefit is that it helps lower emotional levels.

This is the most important for me. 

Do you often feel like your head is full? What are the effects? Often angry, wants to cry, sensitive, etc.

Through meditation, our emotional level can drop slowly to a calm and comfortable stage.

It is like inside our head there is a monkey running. Sometimes he runs to the past, sometimes he runs back to the future. 

Through meditation, this monkey becomes calmer.

Have you tried meditation as a remedy for pain?
